The regularization parameter, <i>C</i>, has no intuitive meaning, but <i>C</i> = &#8734; leads to a hard margin SVM and the following table should help understand the tradeoffs that $C$ invokes.

"The value of epsilon determines the level of accuracy of the approximated function.  It relies entirely on the target values in the training set.  If epsilon is larger than the range of the target values we cannot expect a good result.  If epsilon is zero, we can expect overfitting.  Epsilon must therefore be chosen to reflect the data in some way.  Choosing epsilon to be a certain accuracy does of course only guarantee that accuracy on the training set; often to achieve a certain accuracy overall, we need to choose a slightly smaller epsilon."

abstract = {Kernel is the heart of kernel based learning. To choose an appropriate parameter for a specific kernel is an important research issue in the data mining area. In this paper, we propose an automatic parameter selection approach for polynomial kernel. The algorithm is tested on support vector machines (SVM). The parameter selection is considered on the basis of prior information of the data distribution and Bayesian inference. The new approach is tested on different sizes of benchmark datasets with binary class problems as well as multi class classification problems.}

abstract = {In this paper we address two aspects related to the exploitation of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification in real application domains, such as the detection of objects in images. The first one concerns the reduction of the run-time complexity of a reference classifier, without increasing its generalization error. In fact we show that the complexity in test phase can be reduced by training SVM classifiers on a new set of features obtained by using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Moreover, due to the small number of features involved, we explicitly map the new input space in the feature space induced by the adopted kernel function. Since the classifier is simply a hyperplane in the feature space, then the classification of a new pattern involves only the computation of a dot product between the normal to the hyperplane and the pattern. The second issue concerns the problem of parameter selection. In particular we show that the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, measured on a suitable validation set, are effective for selecting, among the classifiers the machine implements, the one having performances similar to the reference classifier. We address these two issues for the particular application of detecting goals during a football match.}

abstract = {A heuristic is proposed to address free parameter selection for Support Vector Machines, with the goals of improving generalization performance and providing greater insensitivity to training set selection. The many local extrema in these optimization problems make gradient descent algorithms impractical. The main point of the proposed heuristic is the inclusion of a model complexity measure to improve generalization performance. We also use simulated annealing to improve parameter search efficiency compared to an exhaustive grid search, and include an intensity-weighted centre of mass of the most optimum points to reduce volatility. We examine two standard classification problems for comparison, and apply the heuristic to bioinformatics and retinal electrophysiology classification.}

abstract = {Selection of the kernel parameters is critical to the performance of Support Vector Machines (SVMs), directly impacting the generalization and classification efficacy of the SVM. An automated procedure for parameter selection is clearly desirable given the intractable problem of exhaustive search methods. The authors' previous work in this area involved analyzing the SVM training data margin distributions for a Gaussian kernel in order to guide the kernel parameter selection process. The approach entailed several iterations of training the SVM in order to minimize the number of support vectors.  Our continued investigation of unsupervised kernel parameter selection has led to a scheme employing selection of the parameters before training occurs. Statistical methods are applied to the Gram matrix to determine kernel optimization in an unsupervised fashion.  This preprocessing framework removes the requirement for iterative SVM training.  Empirical results will be presented for the ``toy'' checkerboard and quadboard problems.}

abstract = {We discuss empirical comparison of analytical methods for model selection. Currently, there is no consensus on the best method for finite-sample estimation problems, even for the simple case of linear estimators. This article presents empirical comparisons between classical statistical methods---Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC)---and the structural risk minimization (SRM) method, based on Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) theory, for regression problems. Our study is motivated by empirical comparisons in Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman (2001), which claims that the SRM method performs poorly for model selection and suggests that AIC yields superior predictive performance. Hence, we present empirical comparisons for various data sets and different types of estimators (linear, subset selection, and $k$-nearest neighbor regression). Our results demonstrate the practical advantages of VC-based model selection; it consistently outperforms AIC for all data sets. In our study, SRM and BIC methods show similar predictive performance. This discrepancy (between empirical results obtained using the same data) is caused by methodological drawbacks in Hastie et al. (2001), especially in their loose interpretation and application of SRM method. Hence, we discuss methodological issues important for meaningful comparisons and practical application of SRM method. We also point out the importance of accurate estimation of model complexity (VC-dimension) for empirical comparisons and propose a new practical estimate of model complexity for $k$-nearest neighbors regression.}

For SVMs with L1 soft-margin formulation, none of the simple measures yields a performance uniformly as good as $k$-fold cross validation; Joachims' Xi-Alpha bound and the GACV of Wahba et al. come next and perform reasonably well. For SVMs with L2 soft-margin formulation, the radius margin bound gives a very good prediction of optimal hyperparameter values.}

abstract = {Support vector machines (SVMs) have become one of the most popular methods in machine learning during the last years. A special strength is the use of a kernel function to introduce nonlinearity and to deal with arbitrarily structured data. Usually the kernel function depends on certain parameters, which, together with other parameters of the SVM, have to be tuned to achieve good results. However, finding good parameters can become a real computational burden as the number of parameters and the size of the dataset increases. In this paper we propose an algorithm to deal with the model selection problem, which is based on the idea of learning an online Gaussian process model of the error surface in parameter space and sampling systematically at points for which the so called expected improvement is highest. Our experiments show that on this way we can find good parameters very efficiently.}

The Bayesian approach gives the gradients of the evidence as averages over the posterior, which can be approximated using hybrid Monte Carlo simulation (HMC). By using the Nystrom approximation to the SVM kernel, our method significantly reduces the dimensionality of the space to be simulated in the HMC. We show that this speeds up the running time of the HMC simulation from $O(n^2)$ (with a large prefactor) to effectively $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of training samples.

    Informed Parameter Setting for Support Vector Machines:
    Using Additional User Knowledge in Classification Tasks


    Many applications of machine learning involve the learning of
    classifiers.  Given a set of labeled training examples, the task
    is to learn a classifier for predicting the labels of previously
    unseen examples.  By providing the labels of the training examples,
    the user already specifies a lot of her or his knowledge about the
    classification problem at hand.  In some cases, however, the user
    may not be satisified with the result provided by the learning
    method.  Hence the user may want to specificy additional knowledge
    about the problem or constraints on the desired solution and she or
    he may want the learner to provide a classifier that fits better to
    her or his needs.
       The goal of this research is to allow the user to specify
    additional knowledge about the classification problem and to
    incorporate this knowledge into the learning process.  In this work,
    support vector machines (SVMs) were chosen as learning methods for
    classifiers.  Two methods for integrating user knowledge into the
    learning process of an SVM for classification tasks are discussed.
    Example weighting allows the user to set individual weights for
    individual traning examples, which are then used in SVM training.
    Kernel modification allows the incorporation of a user's knowledge
    about similarities and dissimilarities of examples into the SVM
    training by modified kernel functions.

abstract = {Predictive data modeling is germane to many engineering and scientific applications. Recently, a new type of learning machine, called \textit{support vector machine} (svm), has gained prominence for predictive modeling of classification and regression problems. However, the solution of svm requires some user specified parameters called \textit{hyperparameters }. In practice these are determined by a computationally intensive grid search.\\
In this research, we develop a principled approach for the selection of svm hyperparameters. The proposed three step methodology consists of determination of parametric ranges based on their interrelationships, setting up experimental designs for an efficient exploration of the error surface, and pursuing generating set search for local refinement. We demonstrate its efficacy for software module classification and effort prediction problems.}

abstract = {Support vector regression (SVR) based on statistical learning is a useful tool for nonlinear regression problems. The SVR method deals with data in a high dimension space by using linear quadratic programming techniques. As a consequence, the regression result has optimal properties. However, if parameters were not properly selected, overfitting and/or underfilling phenomena might occur in SVR. Two parameters $\sigma$, the width of Gaussian kernels and $\epsilon$, the tolerance zone in the cost function are considered in this research. We adopted the concept of the sampling theory into Gaussian filter to deal with parameter $\sigma$. The idea is to analyze the frequency spectrum of training data and to select a cut-off frequency by including 90% of power in spectrum. The corresponding $\sigma$ can then be obtained through the sampling theory. In our simulations, it can be found that good performances are observed when the selected frequency is near the cut-off frequency. For another parameter $\epsilon$, it is a tradeoff between the number of support vectors and the RMSE. By introducing the confidence interval concept, a suitable selection of $\epsilon$ can be obtained. The idea is to use the $L_{1}$-norm (i.e., when $\epsilon$ = 0 ) to estimate the noise distribution of training data. When $\epsilon$ is obtained by selecting the 90\% confidence interval, simulations demonstrated superior performance in our illustrative example. By our systematical design, proper values of $\sigma$ and $\epsilon$ can be obtained and the resultant system performances are nice in all aspects.}

abstract = {Dynamic reconstruction is an inverse problem that deals with reconstructing the dynamics of an unknown system, given a noisy time-series representing the evolution of one variable of the system with time. The reconstruction proceeds by utilizing the time-series to build a predictive model of the system and, then, using iterated prediction to test what the model has learned from the training data on the dynamics of the system. In this paper, we review the details of the theoretical derivation of the Support Vector Machine (SVM); this allows us to derive its close relationship with the regularized radial basis function. The dependence of the SVM performance on the choice of its parameters is investigated both by means of theoretical analysis and numerical experiments performed on the well-known Lorenz system. The results obtained show the effectiveness of the SVM in performing the nonlinear reconstruction; its main advantage consists in the possibility of trading off the required accuracy with the number of Support Vectors.}

Subsequently, the total generalization error is evaluated for a separate set of test data. Derivatives of functions by which the optimization problem is defined, are evaluated in an analytical way, where an existing Cholesky decomposition needed for solving the quadratic SVM, is exploited. The approach is implemented and tested on a couple of standard data sets with up to 4,800 patterns. The results show a significant reduction of the generalization error, an increase of the margin, and a reduction of the number of support vectors in all cases where the data sets are sufficiently large.

abstract = {We determine the asymptotically optimal choice of the parameter $nu$ for classifiers of $nu$-support vector machine ($nu$-SVM) type which has been introduced by Scho{\"o}lkopf et al. [14]. It turns out that $nu$ should be a close upper estimate of twice the optimal Bayes risk provided that the classifier uses a so-called universal kernel such as the Gaussian RBF kernel. Moreover, several experiments show that this result can be used to implement some modified cross validation procedures which improve standard cross validation for $nu$-SVMs.}

conclusion = "In this paper we have shown that an asymptotical optimal choice of the regularization parameter $nu$ for $nu$-SVM's is an arbitrary close upper bound of twice the Bayes risk of the considered optimization problem. [...]"


\citep{Steinwart03} considered $nu$-SVMs for classification and showed that an asymptotical optimal choice of the regularization parameter $nu$ is an arbitrary close upper bound of twice the optimal Bayes risk provided that the classifier uses a so-called universal kernel such as the Gaussian RBF kernel.

abstract = {Based on statistical learning theory, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a novel type of learning machine, and it contains polynomial, neural network and radial basis function (RBF) as special cases. In the RBF case, the Gaussian kernel is commonly used, while the spread parameter $\sigma$ in the Gaussian kernel is essential to generalization performance of SVMs. In this paper, determination of $\sigma$ is studied based on discussions of the influence of $\sigma$ on generalization performance. For classification problems, the optimal $\sigma$ can be computed on the basis of Fisher discrimination. And for regression problems, based on scale space theory, we demonstrate the existence of a certain range of $\sigma$, within which the generalization performance is stable. An appropriate $\sigma$ within the range can be achieved via dynamic evaluation. In addition, the lower bound of iterating step size of $\sigma$ is given. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the presented method.}

abstract = {Choosing optimal parameters for support vector regression (SVR) is an important step in SVR design, which strongly affects the performance of SVR. In this paper, based on the analysis of influence of SVR parameters on generalization error,a new approach with two steps is proposed for selecting SVR parameters. First the kernel function and SVM parameters are optimized roughly through genetic algorithm, then the kernel parameter is finely adjusted by local linear search. This approach has been successfully applied to the prediction model of the sulfur content in hot metal. The experiment results show that the proposed approach can yield better generalization performance of SVR than other methods.}

abstract = {In [1], with the evidence framework, the almost inversely linear dependency between the optimal parameter $r$ in norm-$r$ support vector regression machine $r$-SVR and the Gaussian input noise is theoretically derived. When $r$ takes a non-integer value, $r$-SVR cannot be easily realized using the classical QP optimization method. This correspondence attempts to achieve two goals: (1) The Newton-decent-method based implementation procedure of $r$-SVR is presented here; (2) With this procedure, the experimental studies on the dependency between the optimal parameter $r$ in $r$-SVR and the Gaussian noisy input are given. Our experimental results here confirm the theoretical claim in [1].}

abstract = {This study demonstrates a combined application of chaos theory and support vector machine (SVM) in the analysis of chaotic time series with a very large sample data record. A large data record is often required and causes computational difficulty. The decomposition method is used in this study to circumvent this difficulty. The various parameters inherent in chaos technique and SVM are optimised, with the assistance of an evolutionary algorithm, to yield the minimal prediction error. The performance of the proposed scheme, EC-SVM, is demonstrated on two daily runoff time series: Tryggev{\ae}lde catchment, Denmark and the Mississippi River at Vicksburg. The prediction accuracy of the proposed scheme is compared with that of the conventional approach and the recently introduced inverse approach. This comparison shows that EC-SVM yields a significantly lower normalised RMSE value of 0.347 for the Tryggev{\ae}lde catchment runoff and 0.0385 for the Mississippi River flow compared to 0.444 and 0.2064, respectively, resulting from the conventional approach. A slight improvement in accuracy was obtained by analysing the first difference or the daily flow difference time series. It should be noted, however, that the computational speed in analysing the daily flow difference time series is significantly much faster than that of the daily flow time series.}

"The selection of appropriate values for the three parameters (C, e, s) in the above expressions has been proposed by various researchers. Cherkassky & Mulier (1998) suggested the use of cross-validation for the SVM parameter choice. Mattera & Haykin (1999) proposed the parameter C to be equal to the range of output values. They also proposed the selection of the e value to be such that the percentage of support vectors in the SVM regression model is around 50% of the number of samples. Smola et al. (1998) assigned optimal e values as proportional to the noise variance, in agreement with general sources on SVM. Cherkassky & Ma (2004) proposed the selection of e parameters based on the estimated noise. Different approaches yield different values for the three parameters. As shown later, this study finds the optimal parameter set simultaneously by minimising the prediction error as the objective function."<br />
